An ebook that one can read from front to back, covering the shell and CLI tools, Git basics, Makefiles, Configuration files, as well as a bit of Teamwork, Testing, Error-Handling, and Packaging. The level is mostly basic (also for people that have barely any previous experience with programming), but covers a wide range of essential skills. While Python is in the name, this is not really required.
